// Another exploratory attempt...which could be improved somehow or perhaps
// replaced entirely.  It may be a synonym for what MODULE! was supposed
// to be able to do, but does not quite do today.
//
// A RenPackage is simply a way of keeping some files up to date in the
// Ren Garden system.  A package's files may be cached in the binary as
// resources, but it may be desirable to update them even without updating
// Ren Garden.  The goal is to find a suitable directory on the user's
// system to put the files.
//
// It doesn't do any dynamic updates as of yet, only testing the network
// API.  Just gets the files out of the QRC resource embedded in the
// Ren Garden executable for now.
