// This is currently the main include file for using Ren in projects.  At
// one time, there was an attempt to make "ren.hpp" only speak about data
// and "runtime.hpp" provide the runtime services, with the additional
// ability to include either "red.hpp" or "rebol.hpp" to get specific
// features.  However, which runtime you control is currently done by
// the build... not the headers, and you just include ren.hpp.
//

#include "value.hpp"
#include "atoms.hpp"
#include "words.hpp"
#include "series.hpp"
#include "strings.hpp"
#include "arrays.hpp"
#include "error.hpp"
#include "function.hpp"
#include "runtime.hpp"
#include "engine.hpp"
#include "context.hpp"

// !!! Even non-GUI builds want to be able to process images.  Yet this
// probably should be in the category of things done with a plug-in,
// (once plug-ins can act like fairly natural types)
//
#include "image.hpp"


//
// INCLUDE REBOL OR RED RUNTIME INSTANCE
//
// They will define an object derived from ren::Runtime, named ren::runtime
//


#include "rencpp/rebol.hpp" // cheating for now, no C++ version...


//
// HELPER TOOLS
//

//
// Things like the variadic print.  These perhaps should not be automatically
// included, but fun to do so for now.  Consider them a grab bag of ideas...
// like premade parse helper classes should go in there.
